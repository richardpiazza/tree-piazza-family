Using CloudTreeWeb, you can access family trees created in MacFamilyTree or MobileFamilyTree over the Internet. You can access your family trees yourself, but CloudTreeWeb also allows you to collaborate with users on a family tree who use Windows or Android. For example, you can invite family members to collaborate who don't use a Mac, iPhone or iPad to get valuable data for your family tree.";

For details on inviting in MacFamilyTree or MobileFamilyTree, refer to the user manual of the software. Once the invitation is made, send that person the invitation link - for example, by email or messenger.

First, you need a free Apple ID, which you can $BEGINLINK$register here$ENDLINK$ for free. After successfully registering your Apple ID, use it to log in to CloudTreeWeb. Once the registration is done, accept the invitation link by clicking on the 'Accept CloudTree invitation' link below and enter the link there.

The way CloudTreeWeb works, third parties are blocked from accessing your data - even we, as developers, do not have access to your family tree data. This is possible because CloudTreeWeb queries the family tree data directly from Apple iCloud from your computer or cell phone, without a detour through our servers. Thus, CloudTreeWeb meets the same security standards as Apple's own iCloud.com website, for example. Please make sure that your Apple ID is protected sufficiently - for example, by using a password that you do not use with any other service and by enabling two-factor authentication.";
